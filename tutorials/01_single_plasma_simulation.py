Basics of plasma simulation
===========================

This tutorial illustrates the basics of carrying out a plasma simulation
with Wake-T:

- Send beam through plasma target.
- Simulate a laser-driven stage.
- Specify a custom density profile.
- Analyze output data.

All cases are simulated using the ``'quasistatic_2d'`` wakefield model.

# Simple plasma target
# --------------------
#
# To demonstrate the basic workflow of carrying out a plasma simulation we
# will begin with the simplest setup: sending an electron beam a through a
# plasma target of constant density.
#
# Generate initial particle bunch
# ```````````````````````````````
# As a first step, let's generate a gaussian electron beam and keep a copy
# of it for later use:

from wake_t.utilities.bunch_generation import get_gaussian_bunch_from_size

# Beam parameters.
emitt_nx = emitt_ny = 1e-6  # m
s_x = s_y = 3e-6  # m
s_t = 3.  # fs
gamma_avg = 100 / 0.511
gamma_spread = 1.  # %
q_bunch = 30  # pC
xi_avg = 0.  # m
n_part = 1e4

# Create particle bunch.
bunch = get_gaussian_bunch_from_size(
    emitt_nx, emitt_ny, s_x, s_y, gamma_avg, gamma_spread, s_t, xi_avg,
    q_bunch, n_part, name='elec_bunch')

# Store bunch copy (will be needed later).
bunch_bkp = bunch.copy()

# Show phase space.
bunch.show()

# %%
# Simulate propagation through target
# ```````````````````````````````````
# Next, we define the plasma target by using the general ``PlasmaStage`` class.
#
# The basic parameters which need to be provided are the length and density of
# the target, the wakefield model, and the parameters required by the
# particular model chosen.
#
# For the ``'quasistatic_2d'`` model, the needed parameters are the
# limits of the simulation box ``xi_max``, ``xi_min`` and ``r_max``, the number
# of grid elements ``n_xi`` and ``n_r`` along each direction, as well as the
# number of particles per cell (optional, ``ppc=2`` by default).

from wake_t import PlasmaStage

plasma_target = PlasmaStage(
    length=1e-2, density=1e23, wakefield_model='quasistatic_2d',
    xi_max=30e-6, xi_min=-30e-6, r_max=30e-6, n_xi=60, n_r=30, ppc=4)

# %%
# Once the target is defined, we can track the beam through it simply by doing:
plasma_target.track(bunch)

# %%
# .. note::
#   The first time that ``track`` is called in a ``PlasmaStage``, a
#   just-in-time compilation of the most compute-intensive methods is performed
#   by ``numba``. This compilation usually takes approx. 10 s, but it only
#   has to be performed once. Following calls to ``track`` will skip this step.

# %%
# The final phase space of the bunch shows the expected energy loss towards the
# tail as well as the emittance increase due to the non-uniform focusing
# fields:
bunch.show()

# %%
# Plasma target with laser driver
# -------------------------------
# To increase the complexity of the simulation, we will now add a laser driver
# to the plasma stage.
#
# Wake-T currently supports several laser profiles, namely
# Gaussian, flattened Gaussian and Laguerre-Gauss. For the example below, we
# will add a Gaussian pulse placed :math:`60 \ \mathrm{\mu m}` ahead of the
# electron bunch.
#
# The size of the box has been increased to be able to fit the laser, and a
# higher resolution is also used to properly resolve the pulse.

from wake_t import GaussianPulse

# Get again the original distribution.
bunch = bunch.copy()

# Laser parameters.
laser_xi_c = 60e-6  # m (laser centroid in simulation box)
w_0 = 40e-6  # m
a_0 = 3
tau = 30e-15  # fs (FWHM in intensity)

# Create Gaussian laser pulse.
laser = GaussianPulse(laser_xi_c, w_0=w_0, a_0=a_0, tau=tau, z_foc=0.)

# Create plasma target (including laser driver).
plasma_target = PlasmaStage(
    length=1e-2, density=1e23, wakefield_model='quasistatic_2d',
    xi_max=90e-6, xi_min=-40e-6, r_max=100e-6, n_xi=260, n_r=100, ppc=4,
    laser=laser)

# Track bunch.
plasma_target.track(bunch)

# Show final phase space.
bunch.show()

# %%
# Now that the plasma is driven by a laser, the electron bunch experiences an
# energy gain of around 100 MeV, showing also clear signs of beam loading.
# Although still mismatched to the focusing fields, the emittance growth is now
# largely reduced.

# %%
# LPA stage with guiding and custom density profile
# -------------------------------------------------
#
# The final simulation example of this tutorial presents a more complete setup
# by adding a custom non-uniform longitudinal density profile as well as a
# parabolic transverse profile for laser guiding.
#
# Defining the longitudinal density profile
# `````````````````````````````````````````
#
# The ``density`` parameter of the ``PlasmaStage`` accepts as an input either
# a constant value (as seen in the example above) or a function of ``z``, the
# longitudinal position along the stage.
#
# The code below shows an example of a user-provided density profile.

import numpy as np

        1 / (1 + (z - ramp_up - plateau) / ramp_decay_length)**2, n)
    # Make zero after downramp.
    n = np.where( z > ramp_up + plateau + ramp_down, 0, n)
    # Return absolute density.
    return n * np0

# %%
# Defining the radial density profile
# ```````````````````````````````````
# Currently, Wake-T supports only a limited tunability of the transverse
# profile: either a uniform density (default), or a parabolic shape.
#
# The parabolic shape is set by using the ``parabolic_coefficient`` parameter,
# which imprints a profile given by
# ``n_r = n_p * (1 + parabolic_coefficient * r**2)``, where n_p is the local
# on-axis plasma density and ``r`` the radial coordinate.
#
# Similarly to the ``density`` parameter, the ``parabolic_coefficient`` can
# also be a constant of a function of ``z``. In this example, we will assume
# that it is constant and matched to the laser spot size for optimal guiding.
#
# In addition, this example will also generate openpmd output which will be
# visualized later.
import scipy.constants as ct

# Create Gaussian laser pulse.
laser = GaussianPulse(laser_xi_c, w_0=w_0, a_0=a_0, tau=tau, z_foc=0.)

# Create plasma target (with laser driver and custom density profile).
plasma_target = PlasmaStage(

# Track bunch.
plasma_target.track(bunch, opmd_diag=True, diag_dir='tutorial_01_diags')

# As expected, thanks to the guiding, the energy gain is larger and with a
# smaller sign of beam loading. The plasma upramp also helps in further
# minimizing the emittance growth.
