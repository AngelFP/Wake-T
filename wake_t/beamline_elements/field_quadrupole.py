class FieldQuadrupole(FieldElement):
    """
    Class defining a quadrupole as a field element.

    Parameters
    ----------
    length : float
        Length of the quadrupole lens in :math:`m`.
    foc_strength : float
        Focusing strength of the quadrupole in :math:`T/m`. Defined so
        that a positive value is focusing for electrons in the :math:`y`
        plane and defocusing in the :math:`x` plane.
    dt_bunch : float, str, or list of float and str
        The time step for evolving the particle bunches. If ``'auto'``, it will
        be automatically set to :math:`dt = T/(10*2*pi)`, where T is the
        betatron period of the particle with the lowest energy in the bunch.
        A list of values can also be provided. In this case, the list
        should have the same order as the list of bunches given to the
        ``track`` method.
    bunch_pusher : str
        The pusher used to evolve the particle bunches in time within
        the specified fields. Possible values are ``'rk4'`` (Runge-Kutta
        method of 4th order) or ``'boris'`` (Boris method).
    n_out : int, optional
        Number of times along the lens in which the particle distribution
        should be returned (A list with all output bunches is returned
        after tracking).
    name : str, optional
        Name of the quadrupole. This is only used for displaying the
        progress bar during tracking. By default, 'quadrupole'
