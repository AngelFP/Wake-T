    ----------
    fld : 2darray
        The original field to interpolate.
    z_min : float
        Position of the first field value along `z`.

        Position of the first field value along `r`.
    dz : float
        Grid spacing in `z` of the original field.
    dr : float
        Grid spacing in `r` of the original field.
    z_new : 1darray
        Location of the grid nodes in `z` of the new, interpolated field.
    r_new : 1darray
        Location of the grid nodes in `r` of the new, interpolated field.
