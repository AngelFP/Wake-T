class Tracker():
    """Class in charge of evolving in time the particle bunches and fields.

    There are 3 main ingredients in the simulation of an accelerator stage:
    particle bunches, electromagnetic fields, and diagnostics. Each of these
    elements has a certain periodicity: the bunches are evolved with a certain
    time step (which can be adaptive), the numerical fields are also updated
    with a certain time step, and the diagnostics are generated with a regular
    periodicity.

    Thus, in time, a simulation looks something like:

        Bunch: x-x-x--x---x-----x------x--------x---------x----x|
        Field: x-------x-------x-------x-------x-------x-------x|
        Diags: x-----------x-----------x-----------x-----------x|
        Time:  ------------------------------------------------>| End

    Where the `x` denote the moments in time where each quantity is updated.

    The job of the `Tracker` is to orchestrate this flow and update each
    element at the right time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    t_final : float
        Final time of the tracking.
    bunches : list, optional
        List of `ParticleBunch`es to track.
    dt_bunches : list, optional
        List of time steps. There should be one value per bunch. Possible
        values are any float >0 for a constant time step, or 'auto' for
        enabling an adaptive time step.
    fields : list, optional
        List of `Field`s in which to evolve the particles.
    n_diags : int, optional
        Number of diagnostics to output.
    opmd_diags : OpenPMDDiagnostics, optional
        Instace of OpenPMDDiagnostics in charge of generating the openPMD
        output. If not given, no diagnostics will be generated.
    auto_dt_bunch_f : callable, optional
        Function used to determine the adaptive time step for bunches in
        which the time step is set to `'auto'`. The function should take
        solely a `ParticleBunch` as argument.
    bunch_pusher : str, optional
        The particle pusher used to evolve the bunches. Possible values
        are `'boris'` or `'rk4'`.
    section_name : str, optional
        Name of the section to be tracked. This will be appended to the
        beginning of the progress bar.
